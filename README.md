# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**! This project walks you through how to build an sql-end-to-end-data warehouse. Designed as a portfolio project, it serves as 
an excellent resource to both data engineers and analysts, as it provides industry-best data engineering and analytics solutions, from building a data warehouse to generating analytical
reports, and thus enabling data-driven decisions by stakeholders.

## 01. Build a Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Build a data warehouse that consolidates sales data using the Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.

### Data Architecture
* **Bronze**: Stores raw data as-is.
* **Silver**: Houses cleaned and prepared data.
* **Gold**: Houses business-ready data.

## 02. Analytics & BI Reporting (Data Analytics)

This section of the project is divided into two phases **Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA)** and **Advanced Data Analytics**.

### Objectives
Generate SQL and BI reports that draw insight into:

* **Customer Performance**
* **Product Performance**
* **Sales Trends**

These key business metrics generate insightful information about the business overall performance, enforcing data-driven decision making.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Notion**: Project Planning
* **SQL Server**: Database engine that stores data.
* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): Interface for interacting with SQL server.
* **Draw.io**: For designing the data architecture, data flow, integration model, and data model.
* **Git Hub**: For committing codes.
